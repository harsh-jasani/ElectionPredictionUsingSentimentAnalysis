# ElectionPredictionUsingSentimentAnalysis

Project Description: 

An election gives the people an opportunity to choose their leaders in a democracy. The sentiment of the people towards the electoral candidates is one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election. However, the problem is that the views of the people towards the candidates may change from time to time. When it comes to determining which candidate is favoured by the people, the current opinions are the most important. To know current opinions, any of the social media can be used. In this project, Twitter, the micro-blogging site has been used since obtaining the tweets from Twitter using its API is extremely easy and there are more than 340 million monthly active users. And, many of these users express their views towards the candidates, especially during the time of the elections. This project aims to determine the sentiment of the people towards each candidate by performing sentiment analysis on the data that is obtained from Twitter, to predict the likelihood of a candidate to win the election.
